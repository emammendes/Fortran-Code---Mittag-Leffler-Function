# Fortran-Code---Mittag-Leffler-Function

A f90 implementation of the Mittag-Leffler function. 

## Getting started 

        Simply issue make and then ./test_mlfv on a mac (it should be ok in a linux machine too)

## On the fortran code

The original fortran code is provided by Davide Verotta.  I have simply modified and updated to accommodate the free form of Fortran 90 and  to deal with complex numbers.   I thank Davide for allowing me to make the code publicly available.

The original fortran code is based on a Matlab function developed by Igor Podlubny and Martin Kacena.
