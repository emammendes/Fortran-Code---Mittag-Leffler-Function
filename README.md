# Fortran-Code---Mittag-Leffler-Function

A f90 implementation of the Mittag-Leffler function. 

## Getting started 

        Simply issue make and then ./test_mlfv on a mac (it should be ok on a linux machine too)

## On the fortran code

The original fortran code is provided by Davide Verotta.  I have simply modified and updated to accommodate the free form of Fortran 90 and  to deal with complex numbers.   I thank Davide for allowing me to make the code publicly available.

The original fortran code is based on a Matlab function developed by Igor Podlubny and Martin Kacena which, in turn, was based on the paper entitled Computation of the Mittag-Leffler function and its derivatives, Fract. Calc. Appl. Anal. 5(2002), 491-518 by  R.Gorenflo,  J.Loutchko, and Yu. Luchko
